My journey of learning through materials on freeCodeCamp. My indended course is JavaScript then Front-end technology. I will dabble in Python as well.

rename_to_js.py : downloaded from freeCodeCamp, the files have default extension as `.txt`. With this Python scripts, I input the path to the folder containing my files, then switch the extension of all files to `.js`.
